Botium Toys Security Audit Report
//////////////////////////
Scope and Goals of the Audit

Scope:
The scope of this audit encompasses the entire security program at Botium Toys. This includes all company assets such as employee equipment and devices, internal networks, and systems. The audit reviews existing controls, compliance practices, and the protection of data across all operational environments — on-premises, remote, and online.

Goals:
The primary goals of this audit are:

To assess existing assets and their management.

To complete the controls and compliance checklist to identify gaps.

To determine which security controls and compliance best practices should be implemented to strengthen Botium Toys’ overall security posture and regulatory compliance.

//////////////////
Current Assets

Managed by the IT Department:

On-premises equipment for in-office business needs.

Employee equipment (desktops, laptops, smartphones, peripherals, etc.).

Storefront and warehouse products, including eCommerce operations.

Systems, software, and services (accounting, telecom, database, security, eCommerce, and inventory management).

Internet access and internal network infrastructure.

Data retention and storage systems.

Legacy system maintenance (end-of-life systems requiring manual monitoring).

//////////////////
Risk Assessment

Risk Description:
Botium Toys currently lacks comprehensive asset management and has not fully implemented the necessary security controls and compliance standards (both U.S. and international).

Control Best Practices:
Following the Identify function of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), Botium Toys must:

Inventory and classify assets.

Determine the business impact of asset loss.

Implement controls to manage, monitor, and protect these assets.

Risk Score:
8 / 10 (High Risk) — Due to incomplete implementation of key controls, missing compliance measures, and a lack of encryption and backup processes.

/////////////Additional Comments:

All employees have access to internally stored data, including customer PII/SPII and cardholder data.

No encryption is used for credit card or sensitive data.

Least privilege and separation of duties controls are missing.

Firewalls and antivirus solutions are in place and maintained.

No intrusion detection system (IDS) is deployed.

No data backups or disaster recovery plan exist.

Legacy systems are inconsistently maintained.

Physical security (locks, CCTV, fire prevention) is adequate.

Privacy policies and breach notification procedures are documented for GDPR.

Password policy exists but is weak; no centralized password management system is used.

Recommendations

.To reduce risks and improve Botium Toys’ security posture, the IT Manager should prioritize the following:

.Implement Access Control Policies:

   .Enforce least privilege and separation of duties to restrict unnecessary data access.

   .Develop and deploy a centralized password management system.

.Data Protection Enhancements:

   .Enable encryption for all sensitive and financial data (at rest and in transit).

   .Implement tokenization or hashing for stored cardholder data.

.Compliance and Regulatory Alignment:

   .Achieve PCI DSS and GDPR compliance through controlled access, encryption, and secure transmission of customer data.

   .Develop clear user access policies aligned with SOC 2 requirements.

.Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity:

   .Create and regularly test backup and disaster recovery plans.

   .Store backups securely off-site or in the cloud.

.Security Monitoring:

   .Deploy an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and consider an SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solution for real-time monitoring.

   .Schedule routine vulnerability assessments and penetration tests.

.Password and Authentication Improvements:

   .Strengthen the password policy (e.g., 12+ characters, special symbols, MFA).

   .Roll out multi-factor authentication (MFA) across systems.

.Legacy System Management:

   .Create a maintenance schedule and formal retirement plan for end-of-life systems.

.Continuous Training and Awareness:

    .Conduct employee cybersecurity awareness training to reduce human error risks.
